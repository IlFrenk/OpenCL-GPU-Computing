# OpenCL GPU Computing

Three programs which use the GPU for their computing instead of using the CPU, thanks to [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) framework.  
  
Every program can be launched from the same [interface](https://github.com/IlFrenk/OpenCL-GPU-Computing/tree/master/Interfaccia).  
The three programs are:  
* Matrix Multiply: It multiplies two matrices, asking their dimensions to the user and randomly populating them. Then saves the resultant matrix in a specific file.
* Mirror Image: It takes an image as input and changes its pixels in order to mirror it.
* Filter Image: It takes an image as input and changes its pixels using a Convolution Matrix in order to get a specific filter effect.
